# odin-recipes

In this project, I was supposed to make a recipe website so I did.
I'm writing this after finishing my website (didn't push it to github yet though).
All the recipes here are real by the way haha.
I practiced a lot and made a few mistakes.My biggest one is that I didn't make a single commit throughout the project . It's not that i forgot or anything but I hadn't yet grasped the commit thing yet when i started and then it completely slipped my mind . Didn't realise it until when i was trying to push the whole thing to github to make it into a proper website, which makes me a little disappointed cause all the "hard work" isn't going to show but you know it's better late than never. I'll try to improve on this during the css course.
